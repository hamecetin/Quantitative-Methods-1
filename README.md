I did the computation of:

1) A Baby-Step Stochastic Growth Model with one factor of Production
2) A Stochastic Growth Model with Leisure
3) A Stochastic Growth Model with Wedges

by using the following Computational methods:

- Value Function Iteration
- Linear-Quadratic Method
- Ricatti Equation
- Vaughan's Method

I also did estimation of parameters of some time-series processes via Kalman Filter
